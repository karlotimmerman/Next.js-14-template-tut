/**
 * consider a rename to Event? That being said if we go with event we need to think about a word to pre/post fix event because it is likely to be a reserved word.
 *
 * additional documentation: https://www.notion.so/getpieces/Activity-4da8de193733441f85f87b510235fb74
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 * - user/asset/format are all optional, NOT required that one of these are present.
 * - if mechanism == internal we will not display to the user.
 *
 * Thoughts around additional properties.
 * - hmm dismissed array here, that is an array of strings, where the string is the userId that dismissed this notification? or we could potentially do it based on the os_ID.
